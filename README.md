**DURATION:** DECEMBER 17 2024 TO JANUARY 17 2025

**MENTOR:** N.SANTHOSH



 **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
 
 The system enables efficient management of library resources and supports interactions for both librarians and patrons.
 
 It includes core functionalities such as adding items, checking out and returning resources, searching for items, and managing overdue fines.
 
 The application ensures a smooth experience with a text-based console interface.

**Features**

**Resource Management:**

Add new items to the library, specifying type (Book, Magazine, or DVD), title, author/editor/director, and category.

Maintain a list of all resources with unique IDs for identification.

**User Roles:**

**Librarians:** Can add, manage, and oversee all resources and users.

**Patrons:** Can search for items, check out items, and return them.

**Search Functionality:**

Search items by title, author, or category using keywords.

Display matching results, including availability status.

**Checkout and Return:**

Check out available items and mark them as unavailable.

Return items to make them available for other users.

**Overdue Fine Management:**

Placeholder for managing overdue fines, which can be enhanced with date tracking.

**Data Persistence:**

Save and load library data using file handling or database integration to ensure persistence across sessions.

**User Friendly Interface:**

Menu-driven console interface for easy navigation.

Clear prompts and error messages.

Technology Stack

**Programming Language:** Java

File Handling: Placeholder to save/load data using files or databases.

Core Libraries: Java Scanner for user input, ArrayList for resource storage.

Workflow

**Initialization:**

Load data from a file or database (if implemented).

**User Interaction:**

Display a menu for available actions based on the role (e.g., librarian or patron).

Collect and process user input.

**Processing:**

Execute the requested operation (add, search, checkout, return).

**Output:**

Display results or status messages to the user.

**Exit:**

Save updated data back to the file or database.

Potential Enhancements

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

Replace the console-based interface with a more interactive GUI.

**Overdue Tracking:**

Implement date-based tracking for overdue items and fine calculation.

**Multi-User System:**

Authenticate librarians and patrons with login credentials.

Replace file handling with a robust database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) for better scalability.

**Notification System:**

Notify users about due dates, new arrivals, or overdue fines via email/SMS.

This project is a great starting point for exploring object-oriented programming, file handling, and user-role management in Java. It provides a foundation that can be expanded with advanced features and technologies.
